This directory contains the CodeWarrior 9 projects. Here is what they
are for and where to put them (well, where *I* put them, at least),
and some info on the naming convention used.

Python68K.µ
	Non-shared 68K python, full complement of modules. Put in
	build.mac68k.stand. Uses mwerks_nonshared_config.h.


PythonCorePPC.µ
	PPC shared library with core functionality. Put in
	build.macppc.shared. Uses mwerks_shared_config.h.
MWCPythonCoreRuntime.µ
	A special runtime library needed for PythonCorePPC. Put in
	build.macppc.shared.
PythonPPC.µ
	PPC shared application. Put in build.macppc.shared.
PythonAppletPPC.µ
	PPC applet template. Put in build.macppc.shared.

PythonCoreCFM68K.µ
	CFM68K shared library with core functionality. Put in
	build.mac68k.shared. Uses mwerks_shared_config.h.
PythonCoreCFM68K.µ.exp
	Exports for for PythonCoreCFM68K. Put in build.mac68k.shared.
PythonCFM68K.µ
	CFM68K shared application. Put in build.mac68k.shared.
PythonAppletCFM68K.µ
	CFM68K applet template. Put in build.mac68k.shared.

PythonPPCstandalone.µ
	Non-shared PPC python. If you need it, put it in build.macppc.stand.
	
The rest of the files are for creating dynamically loadable plugin
modules, these should be put into the PlugIns folder.

As an example, ctb.ppc.mu and ctb.ppc.mu.exp are used to build the PPC
plugin module ctb.ppc.slb.

Similarly, ctb.CFM68K.mu and ctb.CFM68K.mu.exp are used to build the
CFM68K plugin module ctb.CFM68K.slb.

The projects with "modules" in their name are somewhat special: these
build shared libraries that contain more than one module (usually
related). The MkPluginAliases.py script (from Mac/scripts) knows about
all modules that live together, and will create the necessary aliases
to make it all work.

All plugin modules use mwerks_plugin_config.h as their header file,
with the exception of the _tkinter plugins, which use
mwerks_tkplugin_config.h.
