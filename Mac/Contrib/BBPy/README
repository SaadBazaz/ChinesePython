"Run as Python" -- a BBEdit extension to make the Python interpreter execute the 
contents of the current window.

version 0.2.3, 18 september 1996

Note by Jack:
	Also check out the BBPy.lm contributed software, which is a Python language
	module for BBedit, providing syntax coloring and function/class navigation.

contents:
-	"Run as Python" -- the extension
-	PythonSlave.py -- the "slave" script that handles the AppleEvents
	
-	source -- source code & CW9 project for the extension

quickstart:
-	drop "Run as Python" in BBEdit extensions folder
-	double-click PythonSlave.py
-	start BBEdit
-	type some code
-	go to Extensions menu: "Run as Python"
-	be happy

warning:
	since PythonSlave.py runs its own event loop and we have no interface
	to SIOUX you *cannot* copy from the console. Duh.

extra feature:
	while PythonSlave.py is running you can still double-click Python
	documents, they will get executed as if Python was not already running.

bugs:
	perhaps

acknowledgements:
-	Thanks to Joseph Strout for valuable input and beta testing.
-	Thanks to Mark Roseman for providing code that can launch 
	PythonSlave.py from BBEdit.


Have fun with it!
Please report bugs, or fix 'em. Suggestions are always welcome.
