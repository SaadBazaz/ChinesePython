These items are plugins for Sherlock, the MacOS 8.5 all-singing-all-dancing
"find file" program. Drop them on your closed system folder and they will
automatically be put in the right location. They will even automatically warn
you when new versions become available!

The "Python" plugin searches the website, the ftp site and the startship site.
The "Python-FAQ" plugin searches the FAQ.

In case the file creator/type of these files was damaged in transit: to work they
need to be creator "fndf", type "issp".
